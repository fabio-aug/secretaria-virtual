Comments:
- Getter and setter methods were not being used were removed just for code cleanup.
- A simple GUI ([JOptionPane](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/JOptionPane.html) and [JTable](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/JTable.html)) was used to build the project.
- Since the orientation of the work was the classes and their fields in Portuguese, everything was created in Portuguese. So the project follows the idea of actions in English and entities in Portuguese.
